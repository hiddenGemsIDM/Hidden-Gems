            <div class="py-3 text-center"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
         <p>
            One of Hidden Gems’ main priorities is to cultivate a community of inclusivity and social activity through the sharing and searching for Hidden Gems. Therefore we see it as an important goal of our website to continually search for, and be open to, new ways to improve the accessibility of our website. We aim to make the Hidden Gem website accessible despite the user’s disability or special needs.
          </p>
            Below is an outline for the approach we will be taking for ensuring accessibility on our website, initially to a AA compliance standard. However, as the functionality and scope of our website grows, we will be continually updating and improving the accessibility of our website. As we build the website, our aim is to look at ways in which we can improve the accessibility, through user feedback.
       <p>
            Furthermore, as WCAG 3 is currently intended to develop into a W3C Standard in due course, we will continually monitor this and keep up to date with the most recent WCAG conformance standards.
       </p>
            Hidden Gems has the following individuals in mind when implementing accessible features and functionality in our website:
            <ol>
         <li>   visually/ speech impaired</li>
          <li> hard of hearing</li> 
          <li> neurodivergent</li> 
         <li> individuals with physical or motor skill difficulties, including the elderly</li> 
        </ol><p>
            Our aim is to ensure that impacted individuals are able to perceive, understand, interact, navigate and more importantly contribute optimally to the website. Thus, the benefits prescribed in this policy are set to not only benefit those that are in the abovementioned impacted groups but general users regardless of whether or not they are differently abled.
            </p>
            <div class="py-3 text-center"><h3>Web Accessibility Policy</h3></div>

            <p>We will be complying with WCAG 2.1 at a compliance level of AA.</p>

               <h5>Images</h5> 
                
             <p> We will have alt-text for all the images on the website so that screen readers will be able to communicate the description to users that require this feature.</p>  
                
               <h5>Audio</h5> 
                
              <p> Audio description will be provided for all prerecorded video content.</p> 
              <p>Audio description will be provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronised media.</p>  
              <p>While the initial version of our website will not contain any audio content, such as advertisements or podcasts, we will have closed captions or transcripts available for any future media of this type.</p>
                
              <h5>  Visuals and design</h5>
                
             <p>   The visual presentation of text and images of text will have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large text, incidental information and logotypes, which will have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours.
                We will ensure the control icons are not too small and not close together so that those that have motor skill challenges.</p>
                
               <p>Screen display and user interface.</p> 
                
              <p> Content will not be restricted in its view and/or operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.</p> 
                <p>Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions, except for parts of the content which specifically require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning, such as maps. We aim to keep vertical scrolling to 320 CSS pixels and horizontal scrolling to 256 CSS pixels.</p>
             <p> Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
              <ol>
                    <li>Dismissible: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;</li>
                    <li>  Hoverable: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;</li>
                    <li> Persistent: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.</li>
              </ol>  
              </p>
               
                <h5>Text</h5>
               <p> We aim to use text and fonts as opposed to using graphics with built in text that would be unreadable by a screen reader. In the event a non-text content is presented on the website, there will be a comprehensive text alternative available to be read out to the user by a screen reader. Additionally, content that is purely for decorative purposes can be disabled by the user such that it is not read by assistive technologies.</p>
              <p>  We aim to use text as opposed to images of text except if images of text will be customizable or are essential to the information presented to the user. An example of an essential image of text is a logo.</p>
               <p>We will monitor the language used in our content to ensure that it is not unnecessarily challenging to comprehend. This will allow usage from people with a variety of comprehension levels.</p> 
             <p>   In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:</p>
              <ol>
                    <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size.</li>
                    <li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size.</li>
                    <li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size.</li>
                    <li>   Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Text resizing will be possible without the use of external assistive technology. Additionally, text besides captions and images of texts will be re-scalable to up to 200 percent without losing content or inducing interference on how the website functions.
            </p>
               <h5> Navigation</h5>
              <p>Consistency, hierarchy and simplicity in navigation features and control is priority in the website design and further iterations. This will allow users to anticipate how to use the website for their needs thus optimising the usability and user experience of the Hidden Gems website.
                In order to allow our users choice and flexibility on how they navigate the Hidden Gems website, there will be multiple ways to access the same page or content. This will be catering to our visually impaired or those with cognitive disabilities while improving the user experience of the website. 
                Firstly, all pages will be linked to the home-page so that users can easily move to and from it. 
                Secondly, there will be a navigation menu that allows users to go directly to the page they would like to visit. 
                Thirdly, a search mechanism where the user would be able to input what they are looking for and be able to search for it directly.
                Lastly at the bottom of each “Hidden Gem” page there will be arrows that allow the user to move back and forth to view the previous and next hidden gem.
                Heading and labels will describe the content completely and accurately allowing screen reader users insight into the purpose of the label. When a user interface control or text field is focused on by the user, a visible border will be visible around it.</p>  
                
            <p>   Breadcrumbing on the website to demonstrate where the user is on the website and the hierarchy of content they have previously viewed.
                
                Links will be easily distinguishable with different colours from the rest of the text and underlined. A trail of links the user had pressed on will be available by the link changing colour from blue to purple.</p> 
                
            <p>   The tab function will be usable and useful to all users of the website. The test process for this feature is to ensure that a user can cycle and navigate through the entire site, without needing to use a mouse or trackpad.</p> 
                
              <h5>  Forms</h5>
               <p> Hidden Gems has two forms, the “contact us” form and the “submit a hidden gem” form. Input provided by the user will be:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Reversible: Users can correct their own input.</li>
                <li>Checked: The website will check for errors i.e if words are inputted in a field requesting for a phone number and then they will be provided an opportunity to correct this.</li>
                <li>Confirmed: There will be a feature to confirm the details the user inputted and then they will be provided an opportunity to correct this.</li>
            </ol>
             
            <p>Status updates on the outcome of the users’ input will be provided to them upon submitting a form. These will be explicit messages stating that a form has been submitted or not. Status updates will be available for the searching feature as well. In the event there is a significant lag in response to a user’s request, a “busy” notification will be provided as text to the user and will be announced by the screenreader.
            </p>
             <p> The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined. We will implement the autocomplete attribute in any forms in order to enable users to use assistive and autofill techniques. This includes if an error has been detected, the auto-corrective features will suggest alternatives unless suggestion could lead to possible security breaches.
                </p>
